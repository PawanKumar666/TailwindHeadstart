# TailwindHeadstart

My first project with Tailwind CSS.

## Setup

1. Install Tailwind CSS: `npm install tailwindcss`
2. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file: `npx tailwindcss init`
3. Add the Tailwind CSS to your CSS: `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`

Flex-Box : 

Flexbox is a layout model that allows you to design complex layouts with ease. It provides an efficient way to align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

### Flexbox Variants

Tailwind CSS provides several utility classes to work with flexbox:

- `flex`: This class applies the flex display property to an element.
- `flex-row`: This class arranges flex items in a horizontal row.
- `flex-col`: This class arranges flex items in a vertical column.
- `justify-start`: This class aligns flex items at the start of the container.
- `justify-center`: This class aligns flex items at the center of the container.
- `justify-end`: This class aligns flex items at the end of the container.
- `justify-between`: This class distributes flex items evenly with space between them.
- `items-start`: This class aligns flex items at the start of the cross axis.
- `items-center`: This class aligns flex items at the center of the cross axis.
- `items-end`: This class aligns flex items at the end of the cross axis.

These utility classes make it easy to create responsive and flexible layouts without writing custom CSS.
